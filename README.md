Lobster Binance OS is not a single-feature assistant, but a unified intent control and task orchestration layer for the Binance ecosystem.

It does not merely summarize announcements.  
It reorganizes fragmented activities, assets, tasks, risks, and execution paths into a unified action view based on the user's goal.

## Core Modules

- Opportunity Scanner
- Asset & Eligibility Mapper
- Conflict Resolver
- Priority Engine
- Action Checklist Generator

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload
