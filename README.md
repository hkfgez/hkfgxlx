Lobster Binance OS

A unified intent control and task orchestration layer for the Binance ecosystem.

Lobster Binance OS is an ecosystem-level intent router and task orchestration agent for Binance.

It does not merely summarize announcements.
It reorganizes fragmented activities, assets, tasks, risks, and execution paths into a unified action view based on the user's goal.

What It Solves

Binance does not lack products, campaigns, or opportunities.
What users often lack is a unified layer that tells them what to do now, in what order, and what not to touch.

Lobster Binance OS addresses:

Fragmented ecosystem entry points

Conflicts between assets and opportunity paths

Poor action prioritization across campaigns, Earn, Launchpool, and tasks

High decision cost for ordinary users

Lack of a unified action view based on the user's real goal

Workflow

Parse the user's goal, link, text, screenshot, or account context

Scan current opportunities in the ecosystem

Map assets, eligibility, and path constraints

Detect conflicts between actions, assets, and existing paths

Rank actions based on user goal, risk, efficiency, and timing

Generate a final action checklist
